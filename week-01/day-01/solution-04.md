# Github #

* We were shown the basic workflow on how programmers work in the IT work place.
* Projects are in a constant motion of change (upgrade/downgrade) while people are working on a project.
* There should be a clear line of communication between team members on when people should pull there works.
* Team members should make sure that the best possible output should be submitted as to make life smoother for everyone.
* Github helps the coder in making sure that his projects have a history that he can always go back to.
* Constant practice and reading reference materials help the coder to become more proficient in using Github. 
* Command line, sublime and github go hand in hand.
* Nothing beats practice, practice and more practice.
