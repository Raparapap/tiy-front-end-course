1. Why do we need lexical scopes?
2. Why do we need closures?
3. Why do we need this?
4. Why do we need behaviour delegation?


Solutions

1. We need lexical scopes because we want to keep variables in a private scopes so that we don't pollute the global scope. It is also a way so that we can use similar variable names within different scopes without affecting or updating each other. 

2. We use closures in Javascript so that we have access in the elements within that scope of the function where it was called. 

3. We use "this" in javascript so that the functions we use would be self-sustaining and can be used anywhere else in the script.
